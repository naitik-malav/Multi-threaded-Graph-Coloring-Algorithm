1. First move to the directory where you have saved/downloaded my files.

2.  To compile (randomgraph.cpp):
        g++ randomgraph.cpp -o ./rg
    To Run :
        ./rg

    To compile (coarse-grained algorithm):
        g++ SrcAssgn5_Coarse-Grained.cpp -o ./cg -pthread
    To Run :
        ./cg

    To compile (fine-grained algorithm):
        g++ SrcAssgn5_Fine-Grained.cpp -o ./fg -pthread
    To Run :
        ./fg

3. Output file generated after running "randomgraph.cpp" is: input_params.txt (which is input file for the other source codes)
4. Output file generated by "SrcAssgn5_Coarse-Grained.cpp" is: ouput_Coarse-Grained.txt
5. Output file generated by "SrcAssgn5_Fine-Grained.cpp" is: ouput_Fine-Grained.txt

Note: if -pthread won't work use -lpthread
